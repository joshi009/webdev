  <h2> Virat Kohali</h2>
  <p style="background-image: url(background1.jpeg);color:red"> Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli]
    (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national
    cricket team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian
    domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds the records for scoring
    most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male
    cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and
    the 2013 Champions trophy.

    Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the
    Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and
    later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen
    for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018,
    he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian
    cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became
    the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step
    down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped
    down as the captain of the Test team as well.

    He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI Player of
    the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two
    occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI
    Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he
    was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national
    level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the
    Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.

    In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN, and one of the most valuable athlete
    brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
    In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with
    estimated earnings of over $26 million. Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable cricketers, with
    estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) in the year 2022.</p>



  <h2>Early Life</h2>

  <p> Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a
    criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older
    sister, Bhawna.[5] Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal
    Bharti Public School.[6] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere
    three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[7]

    In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, espoused his
    younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar
    Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks
    later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[8] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours,
    Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing
    abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket.[9] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of
    being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors.
    Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he
    declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and
    overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli
    persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[10] He received training at the academy while
    simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[11] As per
    Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days at his academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for the
    coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to physically
    coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart.[12] In pursuit of furthering his
    cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[9] Kohli's ardent
    passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he never missed a match.
    With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding respect from the local
    bowlers.[13]

    On the 18th of December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[9][14] During his
    childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the
    one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at
    times.[6][15] Following the demise of Kohli's father, his mother observed a significant change in his personality.
    Kohli appeared to become more mature overnight, and he began taking every cricket match seriously. He harboured an
    aversion to exclusion from games and appeared to channel his entire existence into the pursuit of cricket following
    his father's untimely demise.[9] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after
    which they relocated to Gurgaon.[16] </p>

  <h1>International career</h1>

  <h2>2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint</h2>

  <p style="background-image: url(background2.jpeg); color:blue;"> In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri
    Lanka and the Champions
    Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under
    his belt.[44] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[45] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both
    first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to
    fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[46] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut
    at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an
    incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[47] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half
    century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[48]

    Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured
    Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[49] Despite
    limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49
    runs.[50] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board
    President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart
    Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring
    105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform
    against high-level international competition.[51]

    In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England, due to the
    presence of established and experienced players such as Tendulkar and Sehwag, he was not given an opportunity to
    play in any of the matches.[52] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for
    Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to
    receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023), A certain level of remuneration for
    representing the national team in various matches and events.[53] Despite being awarded a contract, in January,
    Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[54]

    In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was
    selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a
    standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven
    matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102
    balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a
    17-run victory and the tournament title.[55][56] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the Chairman
    of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament.
    Srikkanth stated, "I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his
    ability."[57] Kohli himself has stated that this tournament was a "turning point" in his career.[58]

    In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the
    injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[59] He was also utilized as a middle
    order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[60] In December of that
    same year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27[61] and 54 in the first
    two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, due to the reoccurrence of a
    finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely,[62] which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at
    Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership
    for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series
  

  <h2>2010–2011: Rise through the ranks</h2>

  In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was
    rested for the event.[64] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries
    before the age of 22.[65] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading
    run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[66] Kohli's success on
    the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted
    that "he has grabbed his chances" and that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a
    'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world."[67]


    Kohli batting in an ODI against New Zealand in December 2010
    Kohli's initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May–June 2010, when he was appointed as
    vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. This appointment came as many more
    established players were rested for the tour. However, in the first match, Kohli was dismissed on a diamond duck, a
    rare and unusual mode of dismissal.[68] Despite this early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian
    batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 26 innings.[69] Kohli also made
    his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[70] Later that month, during
    the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3. However, his
    struggles with form started as he scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[71] This poor form was also
    reflected in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where his average was a mere 15.[72]

    Despite his recent struggles with form, Kohli was retained in the Indian ODI squad for a three-match series against
    Australia in October. In the only completed match of the series, held at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored a century,
    earning him the man of the match award. He candidly acknowledged that he was under significant pressure to maintain
    his place in the team, given his previous failures in the preceding series.[73] During the home ODI series against
    New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century in the first match, marking his fourth ODI hundred and
    second in succession.[74] The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, and Kohli's
    exceptional performances in the series solidified his position in the ODI team and made him a strong candidate for a
    spot in India's World Cup squad.[75][76] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs
    from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.[77]

    "He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill."

    – Team India's coach Dav Whatmore at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup on Kohli, [78]
    Kohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with
    193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[79] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the
    ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[80] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[81]

    Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match
    against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[82] In the final
    against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83 runs partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after
    India had lost both openers within seven overs while chasing</p>
