Blackbody radiation is a term used to describe the relationship between an object's temperature, and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation it emits. A black body is an idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation it comes in contact with.

Why is it called black body radiation?

The radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium with its environment is called black-body radiation. The name "black body" is given because it absorbs all colors of light. In contrast, a white body is one with a "rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions."

Where is black body radiation used?
The blackbodies are used for lighting, heating, security, thermal imaging, as well as testing and measurement applications.

Who discovered black bodies?

Gustav Kirchhoff
The term black body was introduced by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1860. Blackbody radiation is also called thermal radiation, cavity radiation, complete radiation or temperature radiation.

What is the law of the black body?

The energy output of a blackbody is a function of its temperature and is not spread uniformly across all wavelengths. Theoretically, black bodies are surfaces that absorb all incident heat radiation. Mathematically, it is described by Stefan-Boltzmann law, Planck's law, and Wein's displacement law.
