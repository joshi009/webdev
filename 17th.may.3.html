    <p style="border-radius: 10px; background-color: cyan;">Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009,
        Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests
        against Australia A in September 2008.[49] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the
        single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[50] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day
        tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable
        Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason
        Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an
        unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international
        competition.[51]

        In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England, due to
        the presence of established and experienced players such as Tendulkar and Sehwag, he was not given an
        opportunity to play in any of the matches.[52] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the
        Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team
        which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023), A certain level of
        remuneration for representing the national team in various matches and events.[53] Despite being awarded a
        contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[54]
