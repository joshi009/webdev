    <p class="c2">Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
        cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
        batsmen of all time,[4] he plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli
        holds numerous records in his career which includes scoring most runs in T20 internationals and IPL, fastest to
        reach 10,000 ODI runs. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.
        Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions
        trophy. He is among the only four Indian cricketers who has played 500 matches for India.[5]

        Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with
        the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team
        and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI
        batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the
        tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him
        the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in
        2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made
        the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and
        in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.
